The median of the countries is 7588 which shows the middle value of all the countires. The mean is 20346 which suggest that there are many countries with low GDP per capita, but some countries have very high GDP which scews the mean to a high value.\n\n# Summary primary_school_enrolment_rate\nThe summary of primary school enrollment rate shows that the minimum enrollment rate is 64.4% which means a country has only 64.4% of primary aged people enrolled in school. The median is 100.02 and the mean is 100.87 which are relative similar which suggests that most countries have all of their primary aged people enrolled in school. The maximum is 138.19 which suggests over-enrolledment in schools.  \n\n# Summary adult literacy rate\nThe summary of gdp adult literacy rate shows that the minimum adult literacy rate is 27.28% which shows that some countires have very low literacy levels among adults.
